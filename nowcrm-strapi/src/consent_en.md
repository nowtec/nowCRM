<h3 id="legal-bases">2.2 Legal Bases</h3>

<p>We process personal data in accordance with Swiss data protection law, in particular the <a href="https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/oc/2022/491/en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" metadata="155874-1721656477">Federal Act on Data Protection</a> (Data Protection Act, FADP) and the <a href="https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/oc/2022/568/en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ordinance to the Federal Act on Data Protection</a> (Data Protection Ordinance, DPO).</p>

<h2 id="nature-extent-purpose">3. Nature, Extent, and Purpose of Processing Personal Data</h2>

<p>We process the personal data that is <em>necessary</em> to carry out our activities and operations continuously, humanely, securely, and reliably. The processed personal data may fall into categories such as browser and device data, content data, communication data, metadata, usage data, master data including inventory and contact data, location data, transaction data, contract data, and payment data.</p>

<p>We also process personal data that we receive from third parties, obtain from publicly accessible sources, or collect in the course of our activities and operations, to the extent that such processing is permitted by law.</p>

<p>We process personal data as necessary, with the consent of the data subjects. We may process personal data in many cases without consent, for example, to comply with legal obligations or to protect overriding interests. We may also seek the consent of the data subjects if their consent is not required.</p>

<p>We process personal data for the <em>duration</em> necessary for the respective purpose. We anonymize or delete personal data, in particular, depending on statutory retention and limitation periods.</p>

<h2 id="disclosure">4. Disclosure of Personal Data</h2>

<p>We may <em>disclose personal data to third parties</em>, have it processed by third parties, or process it jointly with third parties. Such third parties include specialized providers whose services we use.</p>

<p>We may disclose personal data to banks and other financial service providers, authorities, educational and research institutions, consultants and lawyers, interest groups, IT service providers, cooperation partners, credit and economic information agencies, logistics and shipping companies, marketing and advertising agencies, media, organizations and associations, social institutions, telecommunications companies, and insurance companies.</p>

<h2 id="communication">5. Communication</h2>

<p>We process personal data to communicate with third parties. In this context, we process data that a data subject provides when contacting us, for example, by mail or email. We may store such data in an address book or similar tools.</p>

<p>Third parties who transmit data about other persons are required to ensure data protection for such data subjects. This includes ensuring the accuracy of the transmitted personal data.</p>

<p>We use selected services from suitable providers to communicate better with third parties.</p>

<h2 id="data-security">6. Data Security</h2>

<p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data security appropriate to the respective risk. Our measures ensure, in particular, the confidentiality, availability, traceability, and integrity of the processed personal data, but absolute data security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<p>Access to our website and our other online presence is via transport encryption (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SSL / TLS</a>, particularly with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol_Secure" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, abbreviated HTTPS</a>). Most browsers warn against visiting websites without transport encryption.</p>

<p>Our digital communication is subject to&nbsp;– as is <em>generally</em> all digital communication&nbsp;– mass surveillance without cause and suspicion by security authorities in Switzerland, the rest of Europe, the United States of America (USA), and other countries. We cannot directly influence the corresponding processing of personal data by intelligence agencies, police forces, and other security authorities. We also cannot rule out that a data subject is being specifically monitored.</p>

<h2 id="abroad">7. Personal Data Abroad</h2>

<p>We process personal data <em>primarily</em> in Switzerland. However, we may also disclose or export personal data to other countries, particularly to process or have it processed there.</p>

<p>We may disclose personal data to all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">countries and territories on Earth</a>, provided the local law ensures adequate data protection according to a <a href="https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2022/568/en#annex_1" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decision by the Swiss Federal Council</a>.</p>

<p>We may disclose personal data to countries whose laws do not ensure adequate data protection, provided that suitable data protection is ensured by other means, particularly based on standard data protection clauses or other suitable guarantees. Exceptionally, we may export personal data to countries without adequate or suitable data protection if the special data protection requirements are met, for example, the express consent of the data subjects or a direct connection with the conclusion or performance of a contract. We are happy to provide information about any guarantees or provide a copy of guarantees upon request from the data subjects.</p>

<h2 id="rights">8. Rights of Data Subjects</h2>

<h3 id="claims">8.1 Data Protection Claims</h3>

<p>We grant data subjects all rights in accordance with applicable data protection law. Data subjects have, in particular, the following rights:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Access:</strong> Data subjects can request information about whether we process personal data about them and, if so, what personal data is involved. Data subjects also receive the information necessary to assert their data protection claims and ensure transparency. This includes the personal data processed as such, but also information on the purpose of processing, the duration of storage, any disclosure or export of data to other countries, and the origin of the personal data.</li>
<li><strong>Correction and Restriction:</strong> Data subjects can correct inaccurate personal data, complete incomplete data, and restrict the processing of their data.</li>
<li><strong>Deletion and Objection:</strong> Data subjects can have personal data deleted ("right to be forgotten") and object to the processing of their data for the future.</li>
<li><strong>Data Release and Transfer:</strong> Data subjects can request the release of personal data or the transfer of their data to another controller.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may defer, limit, or deny the exercise of data subjects' rights to the extent permitted by law. We may inform data subjects about any prerequisites for exercising their data protection claims. For example, we may deny access in whole or in part with reference to business secrets or the protection of other persons. We may also deny the deletion of personal data with reference to legal retention obligations in whole or in part.</p>

<p>We may charge a fee for the exercise of rights <em>exceptionally</em>.

 We will inform data subjects in advance about any costs.</p>

<p>We are obliged to take reasonable measures to identify data subjects requesting information or asserting other rights. Data subjects are required to cooperate.</p>

<h3 id="legal-remedies">8.2 Legal Remedies</h3>

<p>Data subjects have the right to enforce their data protection claims through legal action or to file a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority.</p>

<p>The data protection supervisory authority for private controllers and federal bodies in Switzerland is the <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" metadata="155874-1721656477">Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner</a> (FDPIC).</p>

<h2 id="website">9. Use of the Website</h2>

<h3 id="cookies">9.1 Cookies</h3>

<p>We may use cookies. Cookies&nbsp;– both first-party cookies and third-party cookies&nbsp;– are data stored in the browser. Such stored data does not necessarily have to be traditional text-form cookies.</p>

<p>Cookies may be stored temporarily in the browser as "session cookies" or for a certain period as so-called permanent cookies. "Session cookies" are automatically deleted when the browser is closed. Permanent cookies have a specific storage period. Cookies enable, in particular, recognizing a browser during the next visit to our website and thus, for example, measuring the reach of our website. Permanent cookies can also be used for online marketing.</p>

<p>Cookies can be completely or partially deactivated and deleted in the browser settings at any time. Without cookies, our website may no longer be fully available. We ask for the express consent to the use of cookies&nbsp;– at least where and to the extent required.</p>

<p>For cookies used for success and reach measurement or for advertising, a general objection ("opt-out") is possible for many services through <a href="https://youradchoices.ca/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AdChoices</a> (Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada), the <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a> (NAI), <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YourAdChoices</a> (Digital Advertising Alliance), or <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Your Online Choices</a> (European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance, EDAA).</p>

<h3 id="logging">9.2 Logging</h3>

<p>We may log at least the following information for every access to our website and other online presence, as long as this information is transmitted to our digital infrastructure during such access: date and time including time zone, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IP address</a>, access status (HTTP status code), operating system including user interface and version, browser including language and version, accessed individual sub-page of our website including transmitted data volume, last website accessed in the same browser window (referer or referrer).</p>

<p>We log such information, which can also be personal data, in log files. The information is necessary to provide our online presence continuously, humanely, and reliably. The information is also necessary to ensure data security&nbsp;– also by third parties or with the help of third parties.</p>

<h3 id="counting-pixel">9.3 Counting Pixel</h3>

<p>We may embed counting pixels in our online presence. Counting pixels are also referred to as web beacons. Counting pixels&nbsp;– also from third parties whose services we use&nbsp;– are usually small, invisible images or JavaScript scripts that are automatically retrieved when accessing our online presence. Counting pixels can capture at least the same information as in log files.</p>

<h2 id="notifications">10. Notifications and Communications</h2>

<h3 id="notifications-statistics">10.1 Success and Reach Measurement</h3>

<p>Notifications and communications may contain web links or counting pixels that capture whether an individual communication was opened and which web links were clicked. Such web links and counting pixels can also capture the use of notifications and communications on a personal basis. We need this statistical capture of usage for success and reach measurement to send notifications and communications effectively and user-friendly according to the needs and reading habits of the recipients.</p>

<h3 id="notifications-consent">10.2 Consent and Objection</h3>

<p>You must <em>primarily</em> consent to the use of your email address and other contact addresses unless the use is permissible for other legal reasons. For obtaining double-confirmed consent, we may use the "Double Opt-in" procedure. In this case, you will receive a communication with instructions for double confirmation. We may log obtained consents, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IP address</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timestamp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">timestamp</a>, for proof and security reasons.</p>

<p>You may <em>primarily</em> object to receiving notifications and communications such as newsletters at any time. With such an objection, you may also object to the statistical capture of usage for success and reach measurement. Required notifications and communications related to our activities and operations remain unaffected.</p>

<h3 id="notifications-service-providers">10.3 Service Providers for Notifications and Communications</h3>

<p>We send notifications and communications with the help of specialized service providers.</p>
